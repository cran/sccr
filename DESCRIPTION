Description: The SC-SR Algorithm is used to calculate fully non-parametric and self-consistent estimators of the cause-specific failure probabilities in the presence of interval-censoring and possible making of the failure cause in a competing risks environment. In the version 2.0 the function creating the probability matrix from double-censored data is added.
